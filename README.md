# munit-test
Initialised maven-based simple Mule flow with working Munit test

# Description

The instructions on using Munit seem a little sparse and have several [brass moustaches][brass-moustaches].

I took the simple echo flow from [the documentation][basic-echo] and have added the necessary parts to the pom, for instance with regard to:-

- Adding the correct repositories
- Stating the correct version of MUnit (NB correct for a project running Mule CE 3.6.1)
